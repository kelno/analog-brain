# Introduction

This tool is designed to overcome your executive dysfunction by asking you questions and leading you to a helpful answer.  
Reimagination of the "The ADHD Analog Brain", from https://adhdanalogbrain.blogspot.com/, as a single page application running in the browser.  
Implemented in React Typescript with Tailwind.  

# Design Philosophy
- Accessibility First: Accessibility is a core priority, ensuring the app is usable and inclusive for everyone, regardless of ability or device.
- Content-Friendly: Iâ€™ve designed this app with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add or update content without compromising functionality.


# How to
## Managing Card Sets
The default sets are located in `public/sets` directory. You can either edit those or load new sets from a different URL. This can be configured in the UI.  

## Add/Remove a language
Available language are automatically computed from the card sets.  
You do however need to make sure each language has the needed metadata in `languageInfo.tsx`.

# Development Setup

The react project is found in the analog-brain-tool subdirectory.  

```bash
cd analog-brain-tool
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Deploy in GitHub pages

1 - Make sure the base is correct in vite.config.js  
2 - Run:
```bash
cd analog-brain-tool
npm run deploy
```

(You might need to run it in a terminal that allows prompting for ssh key password, such as git bash.)
